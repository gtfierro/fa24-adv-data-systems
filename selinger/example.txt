using these classes, create a relation R(name, age) and insert 10000
random records into it. Name should be a string of length 10 and age should be an integer between 0 and 100.

Create a method scan_all_heap which counts all the records in the heap file.
Benchmark the time it takes to scan all records in the heap file.

Create a method scan_all_predicate which counts all the records in the heap file
that satisfy the predicate age > 50.
Benchmark the time it takes to scan all records in the heap file.
