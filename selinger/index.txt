Add a make_index() method to the heapfile class which creates an index on the specified column. The index should be a btree index. The index should be stored in a separate file with the same name as the heapfile, but with a .idx extension. The index should be stored in the same directory as the heapfile. The index should be created on the specified column

The index object should support the following methods:
- scan() - returns an iterator that scans the index in order
- search(value) - returns an iterator that scans the index and returns all records with the specified value
- range_search(low, high) - returns an iterator that scans the index and returns all records with values between low and high

Create the index by looping through the relation and adding each record to the index. The index should be stored in a file with the same name as the heapfile, but with a .idx extension.
