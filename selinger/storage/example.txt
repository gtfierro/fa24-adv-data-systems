Using the classes from heapfile.py, create a relation R(name, age) and insert 10000
random records into it. Name should be a string of length 4 and age should be an integer between 0 and 100.

Import all methods from heapfile.py

Benchmark the time it takes to scan all records in the heap file.

Create a method scan_all_heap_predicate which counts all the records in the heap file
that satisfy the predicate age > 50.
Benchmark the time it takes to scan all records in the heap file.

Create a method scan_all_index which counts all the records in the index file.

Create a method scan_all_index_predicate which counts all the records with age > 50 using the index.
